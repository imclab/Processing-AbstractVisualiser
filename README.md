Processing-AbstractVisualiser
=======================

An Abstract Visualiser Made in Processing to teach people basic coding as well as some intermediate coding.
This Repository follows along my tutorial on YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/user/jamesusespivot) and let's people see and use my code. 

People can also use the code themselves in accordance with the included gpl and lgpl liscences.

### Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer so the information provided below may be by no means be correct but it is how I understand the liscences I've chosen.

#### As understand it this means you can:
* Copy, modify and use the source code for almost whatever you want to
* Redistribute the source code and binary
* Choose not to redistribute any modified code or binaries whatsoever
* Use the source code _with_ (e.g as a library) your own code
* Use the source code _as a part of_ your own project as long your project liscense is GPL compatible
* _Try_ to make money off the source code. For example you can:
  * Put the binary or source code on a website similar to Kongregate to earn revenue.
  * Charge a fee to distribute the binary or source code (with or without extras such as support or gifts)
  * Use the source code in _with_ or _as a part of_ your own project which you then distribute in either of the above ways
  * Use the source code in _with_ but not _as a part of_ your own project which you you then sell comercially as proprietery software

#### Provided that you follow these rules:
* When you distribute the original or modified source code or binary either on it's own or _with_ or _as a part of_  another project you must:
  * Distribute the included gpl and lgpl liscences along with them and
  * Should you choose to distribute binaries you must ALSO distribute the source code
  * If you have use a modified version of the source code for you binary it is this modified source code you must distribute
